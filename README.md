# MindTrails-Data-CalmThinkingStudy

This repository is the knowledge base for the MindTrails Calm Thinking Study (R01) dataset. For more information about the _Calm Thinking_ study, see [the Calm Thinking wiki](https://sites.google.com/a/virginia.edu/mindtrails-wiki/studies/calmthinking).

## Goal
- We try to have a one document to address all the projects related to _R01_ study and major data cleaning issues.
- Each data analysis project has its own folder that contains the code specific to that project.

## Main Data cleaning
- Check the [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/TeachmanLab/R01-Data/tree/master/Data%20Cleaning) folder for the detailed data-cleaning process

## List of project
- The name and hypothesis of each project
  - Which algorithms are we planning to use
  - Which data do we need
  - Select the related tables
  - Follow the main steps of the data cleaning process
  - Does this project need special data cleaning?
    - if yes, have a record of them and if it a general issue add it to the data cleaning process
        - For example; have a column in the participant table for the attrition algorithm which indicates if a participant manually assigned or algorithmically assigned
