version_control <- function() {
  # Ensure you are using the same version of R used at the time the script was 
  # written. To install a previous version, go to 
  # https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/

  # Load packages using "groundhog", which installs and loads the most recent
  # versions of packages available on the specified date ("groundhog_day"). This 
  # is important for reproducibility so that everyone running the script is using
  # the same versions of packages used at the time the script was written.
  
  # Note that packages may take longer to load the first time you load them with
  # "groundhog.library". This is because you may not have the correct versions of 
  # the packages installed based on the "groundhog_day". After "groundhog.library"
  # automatically installs the correct versions alongside other versions you may 
  # have installed, it will load the packages more quickly.
  
  # If in the process of loading packages with "groundhog.library" for the first 
  # time the console states that you first need to install "Rtools", follow steps 
  # here (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) for installing "Rtools" 
  # and putting "Rtools" on the PATH. Then try loading the packages again.
